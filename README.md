# wanzhe0326-Comparison-between-2D-and-axisymmetric-case-Part-01

This file including a sensitivty analysis of loading length and base permeability on 2D case and compared with 3D axisymmetric case.

Huge oscillation of pore pressure at beginning is observed, a sensitivity analysis of loading distance to measuring point/ model width/ soft landing time are tested.

Model size 800 x (3+6+80); mesh size 1x1 

File 1,2,3,4,5 are length sensitivity analysis based on permeability b=4.68

File 5 steolanding simulate the softlanding effect
Combination of File 7.1 and 7.2 simulate the softlanding effect 

File 5 delay 300/600/900 simulate the soft landing time effect.

File 5 wider is 1400 width model, to test the width effect
