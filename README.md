# wanzhe0326-Comparison-between-2D-and-axisymmetric-case-Part-01

This file including a sensitivty analysis of loading length and base permeability on 2D case and compared with 3D axisymmetric case.

Huge oscillation of pore pressure at beginning is observed, a sensitivity analysis of loading distance to measuring point/ model width/ soft landing time are tested.
